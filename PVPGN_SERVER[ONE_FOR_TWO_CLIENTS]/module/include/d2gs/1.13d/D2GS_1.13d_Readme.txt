D2GS 1.13d (build 01) by marsgod

First, this is a TRUE Diablo 1.13d D2GS, not the 1.10+MOD!
So, you need a 1.13d Diablo to make it work. I strongly recommend that you use the Patch_D2.mpq (version 1.13d) from blizzard.

You can follow the instruction in D2GS_README.TXT to install the d2gs.
Please NOTE: The re-based storm.dll in previous release of D2GS 1.11b has been removed from the release package. You should use the orig storm.dll from Blizzard!
And, the d2gs.script should be copied to your Diablo installed directory with d2server.dll.


This D2GS can work with the latest PVPGN.
