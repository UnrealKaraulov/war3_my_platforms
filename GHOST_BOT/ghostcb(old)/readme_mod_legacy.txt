==============================
GHost++ Version 17.0 CursesMod
==============================

This mod brings pdcurses user interface to GHost++.

=====
Usage
=====

1.) If you have already a configured GHost++, just copy your ghost.cfg to this directory.
    You must add next four lines to your config file (ghost.cfg). Change values as you like. More information in default.cfg.

term_width = 135
term_height = 52
curses_enabled = 1
curses_splitview = 0

2.) Otherwise configure your GHost++ normally. Copy default.cfg and rename it ghost.cfg. More information in readme.txt.

3.) After configuring GHost++:
 a.) Run ghost.exe
 b.) GHost++ will now log on to battle.net realms and joins into the chat channels which you have configured.
 c.) Type /commands to see all the console commands.
     You can directly type GHost++ commands
     !load
     !priv game_name
 d.) When you have hosted a game, join the game using Warcraft 3's Local Area Network menu.

Note: Starting from v1.7 you cannot resize console buffer using Properties->Layout. Use "/resize" command or config-file instead.

Note 2: Supports only Latin-1 (Western European) or related character set. Changing keyboard layouts in runtime doesn't work.

=========
Compiling
=========

You need Boost libraries and PDCurses in addition to included libraries.

1.) On Windows:

Get Boost libraries from the web or from GHost++ Google Code -page and compile with Visual Studio 2008 (or something else).

2.) On Linux:

PDCurses requires libxt-dev and libxaw7-dev (or similar). http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/
Compile PDCurses succesfully (check the README-file in X11 directory, make, make install) or get it from your package manager (if it's there).
Remember to copy the .so and .a file to /usr/lib if they aren't there yet.

Get all the other dependencies needed in building bncsutil, stormlib and ghost. See each one's Makefile.
Compile bncsutil and stormlib first and copy the .so-files to /usr/lib, then compile ghost.
You may need to change -lcurses into -lXCurses or -lpdcurses (or whatever the PDCurses' .so/.a filename is called) in Makefile LFLAGS.
You might also want to look at userinterface.h for #include <curses.h> and change it to #include <xcurses.h> if needed.

Note: Compiling with ncurses instead of pdcurses might make the user interface look messy (on Linux).
