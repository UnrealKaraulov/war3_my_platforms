D2GS 1.13c (build 03) by marsgod

WARNING: This server only work with D2 1.13c version! (You can connect with 1.11b, 1.12a, 1.13 client....)

First, this is a TRUE Diablo 1.13 D2GS, not the 1.10+MOD!
So, you need a 1.13 Diablo to make it work. I strongly recommend that you use the Patch_D2.mpq (version 1.13) from battle.net.

You can follow the instruction in D2GS_README.TXT to install the d2gs.


This D2GS can work with the latest PVPGN.
